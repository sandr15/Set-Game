The implementation of the card game, Set.

### Rules of Set
To familiarize yourself with the rules of the game, please read [The Rules of Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game))

##### Point System
In addition to the standard rules, a point system was added to make the game more interesting. The following are the point system rules.
1. If a correct set is chosen, you will gain __+3 points__ :grinning:
2. If an incorrect set is chosen, you will lose __-5 points__ :dizzy_face:

### Motivation
Set is a simple card game. I used this project as a means to gain experience writing iOS applications, and experimenting with iOS API's.

### Additional Notes and Future Enhancements
* For the sake of simplicity, the striping effect on cards was replaced with a shading effect.
  * Marked as a future enhancement
* Add a timing component where score is determined as a function of how long a set selection took.
